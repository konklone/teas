Balancing Todos

- too many projects in beginning (4, advanced tea growth)
x one more worker before temple leader. 150 & 30
- laser focus & techniques of focus?
- too little teabags in beginning?
- speed + way too cheap. start at 1.5 M, 3.2M -> 40M, 1.2G is the correct price.
- same for brewing speed and efficiency. start at 1.5M
- efficiency 200% is final.
- speed 8 is final
- brewing dance and farming bonus too strong. maybe split in two
- add worker (90, 2.5) and breakroom more expensive specially teabags
- spiritual leader only 150 focus
- add two workers available earlier
- less converters. they are too good.
- no project after enlightenment meditation.
- nirvana: 5G & 500 focus

Time to nirvana: 1:10, final production approx 7.5M Tb/s.
500 Focus is ok, with leader and 4 monks
Ok, but a little boring throughout.
Leader & meditation are both not the killer features.
Quite a few projects do not feel impactful. Maybe too many?
