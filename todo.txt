==================== phase 2 ========================

GRAPHICS:
focus-project-box design: costum box, progressbar border and color/style


tooltips & tutorial


Simi:
    Layout overhaul 1
        Box placement
            Worker box placement (left or middle)
        Focus (resource), out of box, in teabag box, new box, ... ?
            Maybe combine cult-bonus & focus ??
        Focus box (more mystical?)
            What is it? Meditation, Focus ritual, ceremony, ...
            Generator vs Converter design
            Progress bar?

    Different colors for the three resources/cult-bonuses:
        Similar to 3rd phase: fire, nature, water
        focus (blue), farming (green), processing (red, rusty, fire)

    Worker icon
    Tab icons for all left boxes
    Better design of cult-bonus
    Color scheme
    ? Monk Tab


Oli:
    x Fix Meditation
    buyable, error message: e.g. "Not enough workers"
    Functional save
    Remove buttons when not possible (or message): +- on workers

    x Monks / Cultists / Followers
        x New worker category (like farmers & processors)
        ? No minus
        x Generate meditation points / focus actions
            x More monks
                x Faster meditation point generation
                x Reach higher thresholds
            x Shown as a charging bar, with (multiple) thresholds
                x How many thresholds? Number of monks
            x Different focus projects require more meditation points
                x More expensive focus projects give much more resources
            x Focus projects use up (all the?) meditation points
            ? Free workers = Shitty monks
            ? Old school meditation also generates new school meditation points

    Rework focus project generation


Balance:
    Invent & Polish story
    Project order -> Balance
    Simpler introduction to focus projects
        beginning only focus generator, only 1
        no cult-bonuses in beginning
        introduce cult-bonus one after other

    ? project "tea-ceremony" gives 1 extra worker

    Meditation has to be possible, or cancelable, or ...
